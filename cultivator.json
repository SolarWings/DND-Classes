A Cultivator might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity\u2014beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The Cultivator learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.",
								"The magic bestowed on a Cultivator ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the Cultivator's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells.

Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.",
								"Once a pact is made, a Cultivator's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of Cultivators spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive Cultivators toward adventure."
