Then in a quick burst of motion, makes an elegant movement of his arm, Spinning his wrist and splays his fingers into a bystanders face as flames explode from his palm engulfing the woman's head in yellow fire. The panic from the crowd wanes when the woman gets up with not a single singed hair. He grins wide at the looks of astonishment and the excited murmurs.",
            "A captain watches with stern disappointment as she guides the hands of her nervous subordinates as they repeatedly attempt to motion a swift and complex set of movements. Try as they might, they just appear to be flailing their arms fruitlessly. Just as she begins to contemplate retiring the training session. Her despair lifts a little when, in the distance, she spots a bolt of fire impacting a training dummy leaving smolders.",
            "A man in strange foreign garb channels his rage into movement, controlled and serene. To his adventuring opponents he appears to be dancing but before he stops on a pose, a barrage of fire, lightning and ice seemingly erupt from his every limb, laying an elemental assault upon the inexperienced travelers.",
            "It is quite rare to find one proficient in the arcane. Though it may come from a myriad sources, the gift of magic remains to be rare in most. Perhaps one toiled away in a tower, meditating on the many theories and equation he found in their books. Or perhaps one derives her power from her connection to nature or a deity. And then there are some who are merely born with arcane potential. Rarer still are those few who may perform grand arcane feats requiring great magic potential. Knowing this, one might be discouraged ever attempting to gain any semblance of arcane power for it would seem to be that magic is only harnessed by the extraordinary. Seemingly defiant of that notion, A Flickwrist is considered to be one who utilizes the lesser magics present within all in the form of their spelldance. Growing slowly in arcane ability but making up for it in utilizing it.",

It can be drawn from within through a basic grasp of the spell and controlled and swift gyrations. The translation of spell into movement, though easy for the mind, is difficult for the body to grasp. Adepts may come to realise that they are essentially speaking through motions but only masters are fluent enough to effectively express poetry through their motions as they reach a point where it is as if their body becomes capable of thinking for itself.",
                "A Flickwrist will realize that it is not the spells that they are trying to master but their body. The energy present within is just the medium to that end. Through great dedication to their art they may achieve that and will be able to turn even this little speck of magic into a force wild and destructive in its capability."

Their life thus revolves around the seeking of new inspirations for their craft or perhaps in the quest for its perfection.",

Or perhaps they seek the chaos of battle where they may put their body to the test, seeing if it can act out of sheer instinct. Some may see nature itself as their muse and travel to distant, lurid lands to observe their environments in all its minutia from the gait of a river to the flight of a bee."

                "When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.",
                "Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it."

                    "Some clerics, especially in a world like Eberron, serve a whole pantheon, rather than a single deity. In certain campaigns, a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such as life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, peace, or one of the nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the Dungeon Master's Guide explores options like these, in the section \"Gods of Your World.\"",
                    "Talk with your DM about the divine options available in your campaign, whether they're gods, pantheons, philosophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your cleric ends up serving, choose a Divine Domain that is appropriate for it, and if it doesn't have a holy symbol, work with your DM to design one.",
                    "The cleric's class features often refer to your deity. If you are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of the references to a god as references to the divine thing you serve that gives you your magic."

The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.",
                "In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.",
                "The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations."

Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.",

In the world-city Ravnica, the Izzet League trains numerous artificers, the destructiveness of whom is unparalleled in other worlds—except, perhaps, by the tinker gnomes of Krynn."

Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.",
                "As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.",

Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.",
                "The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge."

Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.",
                "Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves."

Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.",

A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics.

Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.",

For some sorcerers, the body becomes a conduit for this power, which is collected and stored in the form of natural runes—and which sees a sorcerer named as a Runechild.",
        "The talents of a Runechild are rare, and sorcerers with this origin are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the secrets of their runes can help understand the mysteries of magic. Others sometimes seek to enslave Runechild sorcerers, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for diabolic pursuits. Runechild sorcerers were subjugated throughout the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}, and many of their contemporaries now search for ways to hide their essence—a task that isn't easy given the revealing nature of their gifts.",

Naturally, it was mass produced and packed in small kegs for extremely satisfactory results in\nwarfare. But it was not until a couple decades ago that people discovered another use for this powder. If packed tightly into\na metal cylinder, it could propel projectiles to great distances. The new king of Larcous, Oko armed his troops with miniature\nversions of these 'Cannons' that could be hand-held. The Siege of Gin put this technology in the hands of the talented\nengineers of Eardon and soon, Variations of Oko's design found its way into some in the Royal Army. Though it cannot be\nsaid for sure how many, a considerable number of guilds chase after this technology and some even produce these outside\nthe bounds of Damutis and Sasitor."

They were found to be in tribes located on many of Liberian Isles as well as the coast on the mainland. They were noted to be a convival, lively and free spirited folk with the elders being generally a lax but jovial people while the young are ebullient and adventurous. This picture of leberi life was sadly a brief one, with colonization efforts by the three empires reducing the people to mainly a life of servitude.",

Half-Leberi were theorized to be either the result of ancient human interaction with the mainland or an adaptation to life away from it on the isles. They are Human-like in appearance with the exception of saggy skin, round beady eyes, better height and scale like patches on parts of their body."
